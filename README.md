# Mood Buddy

Mood Buddy is the first iOS app that I've developed and it's vailable on the Apple app store for free. It's a self care app that people can use daily to take care of their mental or emotional health. The current version includes soothing meditation music, exercise logging, mood tracking, journaling. In future versions, I aim to add meditations and reading materials, which are both content-heavy.
